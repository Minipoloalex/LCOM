M - mouse packet (3 bytes after)
K - keyboard scancode (1 or 2 bytes after)
G - change state (from drawing to guessing or from guessing to drawing)
F - finished game state -> change to menu state (could be ommited i both have the information for when it ends and does not come from user input)

Menu options: another possible solution would be sending the packet and have the other do the collision test
A - menu option 1
B - menu option 2
